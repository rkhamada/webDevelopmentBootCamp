This is a simple webapp that let you input a city name and get the temperature and weather condition in real time. 

You can test it out through node.js in your terminal. 



How was it made:

I used node.js with express framework. 

For the weather was used a api from http://openweathermap.org 

The big deal in this project was learning how to get a input from a user and respond with a information provided by the API. 

For this I used body-parder and https modules and use/get/post/write/send/listen methods.
